# Open Data Stack Projects

This repo contains different example project related to the open data stack. So far it contains these two examples:
- [Airbyte Monitoring with dbt and Metabase](https://airbyte.com/blog/airbyte-monitoring-with-dbt-and-metabase)
- [Configure Airbyte Connections with Python (Dagster)](https://airbyte.com/tutorials/configure-airbyte-with-python-dagster)
- Future potential use-cases: [Series: Building Airbyte’s Data Stack](https://airbyte.com/blog/building-airbytes-data-stack)

The [Open Data Stack](https://glossary.airbyte.com/term/open-data-stack/) is a better term for the [Modern Data Stack](https://glossary.airbyte.com/term/modern-data-stack/) but focuses on solutions built on open-source and open standards covering the Data Engineering Lifecycle. The open data stack is maintained by everyone using it. Companies can reuse existing battle-tested solutions and build on them instead of reinventing the wheel by re-implementing critical components for each component of the data stack.

*Open* is so important and often overlooked because it’s what makes the #opendatastack more embeddable with tools from the open data stack such as Airbyte, dbt, Dagster, Superset, and so forth. Letting you integrate them into your services, unlike closed-source services.
